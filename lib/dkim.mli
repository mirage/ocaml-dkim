    represented by {!server}.

    It returns [true] if signature is correct or [false] if something is wrong.

    Establishing the exact cause of a failed verification if difficult:

    - [selector] can not be found.
    - Public-key was updated.
    - [DKIM-Signature] is not well-formed.
    - etc.

    At least, [dkim] provides some logs to highlight where the verification
    failed. Finally, the given email should be treated the same as all
    unverified email - regardless of whether or not it looks like it was signed. *)
